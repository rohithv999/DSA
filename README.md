DESCRIPTION:
Data Structures and Algorithms is a significant topic in the computer science field.
Many companies ask questions about data structures and algorithms during technical interviews to test your knowledge.
Practice makes it a lot easier to show confidence and better problem-solving methods to these types of questions.
It would be helpful to many to have a repository with files about various different algorithms and solutions to solving them.
Our goal for this project is to have multiple users contribute to this repository with various different algorithm solutions.
This will help programmers develop more analytical and problem-solving skills to be able to work out these technical questions more efficiently.
Also, this is a good first issue project for users to learn and get accustomed to open source contributions in github.

POSSIBLE DATA STRUCTURES:
Arrays
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Heaps
Binary Trees

POSSIBLE ALGORITHMS:
Sorting
Searching
Swapping
Traversing
Min/Max
